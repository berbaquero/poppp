# Poppp
Poppp is mobile web app that lets you quickly check the latest popular [Dribbble](dribbble.com) shots.

Once you tap on a shot, you can swipe through them all to get a more detailed view.

I made Poppp as a way of having a quick inspiration source, based on the awesome designs from that network.

It's optimized for mobile devices with Webkit-based browsers (Mobile Chrome & Mobile Safari).

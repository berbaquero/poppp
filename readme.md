# Poppp
Poppp is mobile web-app that lets you easily check the different main [Dribbble](dribbble.com) sections and shots.

I made Poppp as a way of having a quick inspiration source, based on the awesome designs from that network (even though I don't have an account yet).

It's optimized for mobile devices with Webkit-based browsers.

I'm currently working on a layout for tablets and desktops.
